# Nix Development Environment

A robust and reproducible development environment setup using Nix for Node.js projects.

## Overview

This repository contains a Nix-based development environment configuration that provides a consistent and isolated development setup for Node.js projects. It ensures that all developers work with the same versions of Node.js, Yarn, and other dependencies.

## Features

- Node.js 20.x
- Yarn package manager
- Isolated development environment
- Reproducible setup across different machines
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Prerequisites

- [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) installed on your system
- Basic understanding of Nix and Node.js

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Run the following command to enter the development environment:
   ```bash
   nix develop
   ```
3. Verify the setup:
   ```bash
   node --version
   yarn --version
   ```

## Running the Project

1. First, enter the Nix development environment:

   ```bash
   nix develop
   ```

2. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

4. For production build:

   ```bash
   yarn build
   yarn start
   ```

5. To run tests:
   ```bash
   yarn test
   ```

Note: Make sure you're always in the Nix development environment (after running `nix develop`) before executing any of these commands.

## Nix vs npmrc: A Comparison

### Nix Approach

#### Advantages

- Reproducible environments across all machines
- System-wide dependency management
- Isolated development environments
- Cross-platform consistency
- Version control friendly
- Clean environment for each project
- Manages system-level dependencies

#### Use Cases

- Team development
- Complex projects with multiple dependencies
- Projects requiring specific system configurations
- Cross-platform development
- Projects needing isolation

### npmrc Approach

#### Advantages

- Simpler setup
- Familiar to Node.js developers
- Lightweight configuration
- Easy to modify

#### Use Cases

- Simple Node.js projects
- Personal projects
- Projects with minimal dependencies
- When only npm-specific configurations are needed

### When to Use Which?

#### Use Nix when:

- Working in a team
- Need reproducible environments
- Project has complex dependencies
- Require system-level package management
- Need isolation between projects

#### Use npmrc when:

- Working on simple projects
- Only need npm-specific configurations
- Don't require system-level package management
- Working alone on a project
- Need quick setup
